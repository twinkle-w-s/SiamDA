# SiamDA:Detail-Attentive Siamese Network for Robust Infrared Small UAV Tracking
The main contents of this project can be summarized as follows:
1. A customized Siamese network is designed for tracking infrared UAVs, showing superior accuracy in tracking small targets on a public dataset, aiding urban UAV management.
2. A detail preservation network is developed to effectively address the issue of limited information in small UAVs and infrared target scenarios by deeply engaging with detail features.
3. The improved loss function and template update strategy enhance small UAV tracking precision.
